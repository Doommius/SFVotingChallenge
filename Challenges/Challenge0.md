# Challenge 0 - Local developer machine

As a prerequisite for this hackathon, we have asked you to bring a fully functioning developer machine. 

To get started, we challenge you to get our sample Voting application up and running on your local developer machine.

## Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge:

1. Show the instructors that you can debug the application locally
2. Explain how votes get recorded in the system

## Tips

- The application is written in dot net core and can be deployed to either Linux or Windows clusters.
- Services in a Service Fabric cluster will internally be exposed on different endpoints (IP and port), depending on where they get placed.
- Code that you clone from GitHub may or may be fully functional! :-)
