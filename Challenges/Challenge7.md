# Challenge 7 - Auto Scaling

Horizontal scaling of a service is an effective way to plan for unforeseen and/or high-variance loads. Now that your back-end service design is scalable, let's take care of the front-end scalability as well.

Our next challenge for you is to introduce automatic scaling for the VotingWeb service, based on the number of active polls.
