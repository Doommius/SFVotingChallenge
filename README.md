# Service Fabric Voting Challenge

Welcome to the Service Fabric Voting Challenge.

This repository contains a set of challenges, which will help you get introduced to working with Service Fabric clusters and applications. The challenge works with a simple application, which can be used to run polls - the Voting app.

The challenges are intended to be a challenge! They should help you understand the problem, the potential solutions, and give you experience trying to implement at least 1 of those solutions.
